## MULTI-MODEL-IMAGE-CLASSIFICATION-FRAMEWORK-FOR-SAFETY-ALERTS-IN-REAL-TIME-APPLICATIONS

## Project Description

The project focuses on developing a real-time, ML-powered image classification framework to detect potential hazards and ensure safety in various environments. By leveraging multiple deep learning models, the system classifies objects, identifies risks, and triggers appropriate safety alerts, enhancing security and decision-making processes.

## About
The Multi-Model Image Classification Framework for Safety Alerts is designed to integrate multiple ML-based models for object classification and risk assessment. Traditional safety monitoring systems often rely on manual surveillance or single-model detection, which can lead to inefficiencies. This project overcomes these limitations by employing multiple deep-learning techniques to enhance accuracy, scalability, and real-time hazard detection.
